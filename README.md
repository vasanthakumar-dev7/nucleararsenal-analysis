## 📘 Overview

This project presents a **data-driven analysis of global nuclear weapons development** using historical and contemporary records from **1938 to 2022**.  
It explores how nuclear weapons programs evolved through stages of **consideration, pursuit, and possession**, and how global stockpiles and testing activity changed over time.

The analysis highlights the relationship between **geopolitical events**, **arms races**, and **international disarmament efforts**, offering insights into long-term global security trends.

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

- **Nuclear weapons tests by country and year**
- **Estimated nuclear warhead stockpiles**
- **Country-level nuclear proliferation status**
- **Aggregated global proliferation indicators**

These datasets were cleaned, merged, and analyzed at a **country–year level** to ensure accurate temporal comparisons.

---

## 🚀 Key Analysis Features

- Longitudinal analysis of nuclear activity from pre–World War II to the present
- Classification of countries by nuclear development stage
- Time-series evaluation of nuclear weapons possession
- Comparative analysis of testing intensity across nations
- Visualization-driven interpretation of historical trends

## 📊 Visual Insights & Interpretations

### 🌐 Nuclear Weapons Possession Over Time
The number of nuclear-armed countries increased gradually after World War II, with rapid growth during the **Cold War (1950s–1980s)**.  
Since the late 1980s, the count has **stabilized at nine countries**, indicating that while arsenals remain, **new proliferation has largely halted**.

This plateau reflects the long-term impact of **non-proliferation treaties and diplomatic pressure**.

---

### 📈 From Interest to Ownership: Proliferation Stages
- **Consideration** peaked in the 1960s, showing widespread interest during early Cold War tensions.
- **Pursuit** followed a similar pattern but declined sharply after the 1990s.
- **Possession** rose steadily until the late 1980s and has remained constant since.

➡️ **Insight:**  
Many countries explored or initiated nuclear programs but ultimately abandoned them, suggesting that **political, economic, and treaty-based constraints outweighed strategic incentives**.

---

### 💣 Global Nuclear Warhead Stockpiles
Stockpiles expanded dramatically during the Cold War, driven primarily by the United States and the Soviet Union.  
After the Cold War, global warhead counts **declined sharply**, demonstrating the effectiveness of **arms reduction agreements**.

However, stockpiles have **stabilized rather than disappeared**, indicating a shift from arms accumulation to **deterrence maintenance**.

---

### 🧪 Nuclear Weapons Testing Disparity
A small number of countries account for the vast majority of nuclear tests.  
The United States and Russia dominate testing history, while newer nuclear states conducted far fewer tests.

➡️ **Insight:**  
This imbalance highlights how early nuclear powers relied heavily on testing to refine weapons, while later states leveraged existing knowledge and international constraints.
